There is no clever design philosophy to talk about, I tried to find something to work with, and ‘scribble’ came to my mind. This theme uses Open Sans powered by Google Web Fonts, and was written in plain HTML, SCSS & CoffeeScript, though .scss & .coffee files wouldn’t be included in the theme.

## Scribble

A Jekyll theme. [Demo :point_left:](http://scribble.muan.co/posts/scribble-the-jekyll-theme).
